## About me ðŸ‘‹

Originally from Austin, TX, I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Chicago's [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program. I have experience in statistical methods, data analysis, natural language processing, machine learning, Python programming, and data visualization. I'm broadly interestsed in applying these skills to public policy fields, specifically criminal justice policy. 

You can check out some of my projects here:
- [Demographic Change in Chicago](https://github.com/dorottyaf/Superteam-Group-Project): A Python app that allows you to explore, analyze, and visualize both demographic and economic change in Chicago's neighborhoods.

Additionally, there a number of projects that are private for academic integrity reasons, but I am happy to share code samples from the following when requested:
