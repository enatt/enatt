## About me üëã

Originally from Austin, TX, I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Chicago's [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) program. I have experience in statistical methods, data analysis, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. I'm broadly interestsed in applying these skills to public policy fields, specifically criminal justice policy. 

## Projects üí°

You can check out some of my projects here:
- [Demographic Change in Chicago](https://github.com/dorottyaf/Superteam-Group-Project): A Python app that allows you to explore, analyze, and visualize both demographic and economic change in Chicago's neighborhoods.
- [Sentiment Analysis Thesis](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/47b049e7-6c68-4871-9e6d-2abdff1c52b7/content): My honors undergraduate thesis written in R that applies sentiment analysis techniques to Democratic and Republican speeches to test for systematic differences by speaker gender
- [Hate Crime Study](https://github.com/enatt/static): A current data visualization project focused on studying the rise of hate crimes in recent years, built on Altair
- [Hate Crime Map](https://enatt.github.io/hate-map/): A dynamic visualization highlighting the rates of different types of hate crimes across the U.S., implemented with D3 and JavaScript
- [Scraper for Illinois SAFER reports](https://github.com/enatt/safer-scraper): A scraper built with pytesseract OCR software and Pandas to read, clean, and export 80+ pages of public Illinois licensing data

There are a number of additional project repos that are private for academic integrity reasons. I am happy to share code samples from the following when requested:
- Decision Tree Model: Recursively built a decision tree class in Python and applied it to data on student academic performance
- Chicago Parks Webscraper and Search Engine: Built a webscraper in Python using the lxml library to scrape information on Chicago public parks and used sqlite3 to develop a search engine on the scraped/cleaned data
- Hash Table and Markov Models for Speech Prediction: Built a hash table class with linear probing in Python and used it to represent a Markov Model in assessing the most likely author of various political speeches
- REST Database: Set up endpoints for a database of Chicago restaurants using Python, Flask, and SQLite3, allowing for data input, querying, and record matching
